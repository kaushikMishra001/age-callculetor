Variable Naming: Use meaningful variable names. For example, instead of corrent, you can use currentDate.

Code Structure: Break down your code into smaller, more manageable functions. This makes your code easier to understand and maintain. For example, you can create separate functions for calculating age, getting the current date, and calculating days in a month.

Comments: Add comments to explain complex logic or function purposes. This helps other developers (and yourself in the future) understand the code better.

Error Handling: Add error handling to handle cases where the user input is invalid.
